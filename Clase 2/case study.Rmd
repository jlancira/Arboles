This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
maacs <- read.csv("bmi_pm25_no2_sim.csv")
str(maacs)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
g <- ggplot(maacs, aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))
summary(g)
```

```{r}
g <- ggplot(maacs, aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))
print(g)
```
```{r}
g <- ggplot(maacs, aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))
g + geom_point()
```

```{r}
g + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
 
```
```{r}
g + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
```{r}
g + geom_point() +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
        facet_grid(. ~ bmicat)
```
```{r}
g + geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 4, alpha = 1/2)
```
```{r}
g + geom_point(aes(color = bmicat), size = 4, alpha = 1/2)
```
```{python}

```

```{r}
g + geom_point(aes(color = bmicat)) +
        labs(title = "MAACS Cohort") +
        labs(x = expression("log " * PM[2.5]), y = "Nocturnal Symptoms")
```
```{r}
g + geom_point(aes(color = bmicat)) + theme_bw(base_family = "Times")
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
