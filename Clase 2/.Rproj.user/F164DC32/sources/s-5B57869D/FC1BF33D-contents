This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
ls("package:nycflights13")

#?flights
airlines_data <- airlines
airports_data <- airports
flights_data <- flights
planes_data <- planes
weather_data <- weather
# Variables in flights dataset

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
g <- ggplot(flights_data, aes(flights)) #+ scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral")

 

g + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, 
                   col="black", 
                   size=.1) +  # change binwidth
  labs(title="Histogram with Auto Binning", 
       subtitle="Engine Displacement across Vehicle Classes") 
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
